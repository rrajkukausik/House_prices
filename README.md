# UDACITY DATA SCIENTIST NANODEGREE PROJECT - 1

## 1. Project Name - House_pricing
This Project predicts housing prices using Simple Linear Regression.
Also evaluates the performance of the model.

## 2. Installations
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

1. scikit-learn==0.21.2
2. pandas==0.24.2
3. numpy==1.16.4
4. matplotlib==3.1.0
5. seaborn==0.9.0

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

## 3. Project Motivation

As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project  we have to write a Data science blogpost using CRISP-DM.

I was intriguted to analyze and find house prices of the data given other features like no of bedrooms,square feet area etc.
This projects analyzes the corelation of price with other features and use the most correlated feature to predict the price of the house . 

For Summary and more information refer to the medium blogpost for this project: https://medium.com/@rrajkukausik/this-is-how-to-predict-house-prices-by-building-and-evaluating-a-model-using-linear-regression-f1a51ac4208d

## 4.Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Write_BlogPost/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

``` 
ipython notebook housesales.ipynb
or
jupyter housesales.ipynb
```
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
