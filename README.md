#Project Motivation
As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project Term 2 project to write a Data science blogpost using CRISP-DM. I was intriguted to analyze and find business related questions about airbnb listings for Amsterdam city. This interest stem from being a frequent user of airbnb and a curious traveler that is interested in knowning the trends in prices and what can affect.

This can can be modified to analyze other data sets other than amsterdam data.
